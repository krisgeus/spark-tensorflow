## Dependencies

If you want to use the pre-commit hooks, you need to install:

1. [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to convert ipython notebooks to markdown (easier to do PRs this way). 
2. [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for python development. The pre-commit hook exports all dependencies to a requirements.txt file.
